- Hi, I am Yi-Wen Chen, a current PhD student at Columbia Business School specializing in Quantitative Marketing. 
- My primary interest focuses on combining machine learning, econometrics, and economics models to study consumer behavior from fine-grained behavioral data collected by digital technology and its application in business decision making.
- Specifically, I am interested in infering consumers' psychological traits, socio-economic status, and preferences from their digital footprint/mobile data, and predict their behavior pattern to generate actionable insights in marketing strategy. I am also passionate about the ethical issue of AI, particularly algorithmic bias/fairness in personalized recommendation systems and other business application.
- I am willing to share my research results and resources here. Feedbacks and discussions about research are welcome.
- If you have similar research interest with me, please feel free to reach out. I am willing to collaborate with researchers from different discipline.
